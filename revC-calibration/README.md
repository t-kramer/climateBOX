Welcome to the **revC calibration** folder!

In here, you'll find two things:<br>
<br>
a) raw data gathered for the calibration of our sensors<br>
b) the **revC calibration app**
<br>
<br>
The most important thing for you will be the calibration app, which will assist you in calibrating each revC sensor you are using against a reference function.
The app is based on another repository and can be found deployed as a Streamlit app here [HERE](https://t-kramer-revc-calibration-tool-main-mtgpng.streamlit.app)!
<br>
<br>
On this page you will also find some more information about the process.

# Welcome to the climateBOX GitHub page!

The climateBOX is a low-cost unit for personal thermal comfort monitoring.<br>
<br>
With this project we specifically aim to support novices in the field of microelectronics and help you to use the potential of low-cost sensors.<br>
<br>
Things you can find here include:

- full documentation, incl. source files for [program code](./code), [PCB](./pcb) & [housing elements](./housing)
- [building instructions](instructions.md), incl. videos
- [calibration app](https://t-kramer-revc-calibration-tool-main-mtgpng.streamlit.app) & [data](./revC-calibration) for revC velocity sensor
<br>

Also, make sure that you head to the discussions page.

https://github.com/t-kramer/climateBOX/discussions

This is where we post about any updates, ask for your feedback and host our Q&A page.<br>
<br>
<br>

Have fun!
